This site is a demonstration project of a tip calculator developed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The calculator allows the user to enter the amount of the bill and select the tip percentage they wish to leave. The site also includes the option to split the bill among multiple people. In addition, the site is responsive and works on mobile devices. This project is a demonstration of front-end development skills, including DOM manipulation with JavaScript, styling with CSS, and page structuring with HTML.
